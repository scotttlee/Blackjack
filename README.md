# Blackjack
Blackjack game

Typical game of blackjack except the dealer's hand is not shown until the user decides to stand (dealer does not show one card in their hand)
User is randomly given two cards and the total of their hand is calculated for them
User is given a choice whether to stand (keep their current hand), or hit (randomly add another card to their hand and add to the total sum of their hand)
User can hit until their hand "busts" (total sum of their hand is larger than 21)

After user decides to stand, the dealer's hand is displayed (two randomly chosen cards) and the total sum of their hand is compared to the user's hand
If the user's hand is less than the dealer's hand, the user has lost
If the user's hand is greater than the dealer's hand, the user has won

The program keeps track of the user's wins and dealer's wins, calculating the user's win percentage for each program run
At the end of the game, the user is given the option to continue playing or quit
